# Server Guide  🧭

Welcome to the LMU Computer Science & ACM Discord! This guide provides a brief overview of the server and what you can do here.

## Rules  ✅

1. **Be kind**. People are here with different levels of experience. Assume good intentions and treat everyone well.
2. **No Bashing**. We're all allowed to have opinions, but let's avoid bashing other ideas, languages, technologies, etc.
3. **Stay Positive and Constructive**. If there's an opportunity to improve, that's great! But let's all agree that it doesn't do any good to call something out as “bad” unless you're ready to offer a better solution.
4. **Be Welcoming and Inclusive**. All current LMUCS students & ACM members are welcome here, so there will be zero tolerance for any kind of talk that's hateful, abusive, or otherwise intended to hurt feelings. Also, don't be an edgelord.
